# Countries - ReactJS

This project is a web application built using ReactJS that provides information about various countries. 
It allows users to search for countries, view details about them, and explore different aspects of each 
country such as population, languages, currencies, and more. The application fetches data from a RESTful API to dynamically populate the information.
